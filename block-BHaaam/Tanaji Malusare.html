                <p>Tanhaji Malusare was a warrior and commander of Shivaji. A local poet Tulsidas, wrote a powada
                    describing Subhedar Tanhaji's heroics and sacrifice of life in the Battle of Sinhagad, which has
                    since made him a popular figure in Indian folklore.According to the historian David Hardiman, Kolis
                    were the early helpers of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in a revolt. Tanhaji Malusare is one such
                    prominent example of a Koli whose name is memorizalized due to his act of capturing the fort of
                    Singhad and handing it to Shivaji.[6]Tanhaji's father's name was Kaloji Malusare.He was around the
                    time when he took his pledge at Rayareshwar's temple to establish a sovereign kingdom. He was part
                    of Maratha troops in the battle of Paratpgad, where Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzal Khan.</p>

                <h3>Battle of Sinhagad: </h3>
                <img src="assests/media/konkonda.jpeg" alt="map" height="200px" width="200px">
                <p>In 1665, the Treaty of Purandar required Shivaji to give up the Maratha fort Kondhana to the Mughals.
                    Kondhana, located near Pune, was one of the most heavily fortified and strategically placed. It was
                    garrisoned thereafter by Rajput, Arab and Pathan troop guards of the Mughals, such that it was all
                    but impenetrable. The very capable commander at the helm of it was Udaybhan Rathore, appointed by
                    Mughal Army chief Jai Singh I.

                    The idea of Mughals taking control of the fort was deeply disturbing and enraging to Shivajiâ€™s
                    mother Rajmata Jijabai. The conquest was considered virtually impossible but her decision was made.
                    Upon knowing that her wish was unrelenting and set in stone, Shivaji entrusted Taanaji, the only man
                    he could think of capable of finishing this dangerous mission â€” to reconquer the fort Kondhana, at
                    any cost. So Taanaji rallied his troops of 1000 mavals and marched towards the fort in February
                    1670.

                <h3>Unsung Fact</h3>
                <img src="assests/media/tanhaji1.jpeg" alt="killing" height="200px" width="200px">
                <p>During that time, Tanhaji was busy preparing for the wedding of his son, Rabaya. However, when the
                    Chhatrapati summoned him for the cause, he put a hold on all preparations. He took charge of the
                    mission on the condition that he would be allowed to pick 1000 malawas of his choice. Now, the only
                    problem was the location of the Kondhana fort. It is situated on the eastern side of the Sahyadri
                    range, near the point at which Purandar hills branch off into the Deccan. This means that you can
                    only enter the fort from the east or the west via very narrow ridges, which were heavily guarded.
                    The south and north side was covered by a huge mountain, parts of which were nearly perpendicular.
                    Penetrating the fort without notifying the Mughal soldiers was nearly impossible.</p>
