            <p>Google is the world's well-known internet search engine, which is originally called BackRub. Sergey Brin
                and Larry Page established it as a search effort in 1996. They started this initiative to find files on
                the Internet while Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Larry and Sergey created a search engine
                algorithm that prioritised Web pages based on how many other Web pages connected to them, rather than
                the content and keywords. As compared to other search engines, this strategy produced more useful
                results and caused to quickly increase Google's Web search market share..</p>
            <p>ater the name of Google ranking was changed to 'PageRank,' which was patented in September of 2001.
                Because of linking other Web pages to a page, Google's algorithm returned more useful results that led
                to becoming Google's most-used search engine.
                The name of Google is chosen by Larry and Sergey, which is inspired by the term googol. Its stated goal
                is to "organize the world's knowledge and make it useful and internationally accessible," and it employs
                the world's top search engine, a proprietary algorithm.. That means the information on Google can be
                accessed anytime, anywhere by anyone via an internet connection. Generally, it was designed to search
                and retrieve information in order to offer the most relevant sources of data possible. Because of its
                effectiveness, the term "Google" can also be employed as a verb. When you use Google to search for
                anything, you might say "Googled".</p>
